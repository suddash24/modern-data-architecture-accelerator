## 0.44.0

### General Changes

* Fixed bug with eventbridge app for conflicting eventbus policy statement ids

## 0.43.0

### General Changes

* MDAA CLI will now automatically attempt to find MDAA module packages in locally cloned source code when running from within a cloned repo
  * Use of the `-l` flag is no longer necessary
  * When running the CLI from an NPM package, MDAA packages will also be installed and executed from NPM
  * Any specification of a package version on the `cdk_app`/`module_path` mdaa.yaml module config parameter will trigger package installation from NPM, even when running CLI from source code. For example:
    * `cdk_app: "@aws-caef/audit@<npm_version>"`
    * `cdk_app: "@aws-caef/audit@latest"`
    * `module_path: "@aws-caef/audit@<npm_version>"`
    * `module_path: "@aws-caef/audit@latest"`
* (Preview) - Added Terraform support to MDAA CLI. This allows MDAA to orchestrate Terraform modules in addition to the existing CDK-based MDAA Modules.
  * Requires Terraform CLI to be on the PATH, as well as Pip (for installing Checkov)
  * Orchestrated Terraform Modules will automatically be scanned by standard Checkov policies
  * Deprecated `cdk_app` module configuration parameter in mdaa.yaml, replaced with `module_path`
  * Deprecated `app_configs` module configuration parameter in mdaa.yaml, replaced with `module_configs`
  * Deprecated `app_config_data` module configuration parameter in mdaa.yaml, replaced with `module_config_data`
  * Added various Terraform-based implementations of common MDAA modules, managed in a separate Git repo
* Modified MDAA CLI to write cdk.out to separate paths per module
  * This resolves a conflict where concurrent MDAA CLI executions would collide
* Adjusted automatically created resource tags to accurately capture MDAA CDK app name
  * Backwards compatability can be maintained for specific modules by setting the context value `@aws-mdaa/legacyCdkAppTags` to true
  * This context value is used only on resources (such as Ec2 Launch Templates) where changing tag values results in resource recreation
* Bumped to latest CDK Lib version (1.164.1)
* Removed use of variant package dependency versions

* DataOps Projects now create an SNS topic to which all jobs and crawlers will send failure notifications.
  * SNS topic can currently be configured with email address subscribers
* Modified config schemas to make more use of named objects vs arrays, to provide better config merging behaviour
  * Affected configurations are:
    * DataLake
    * Roles
    * Data Warehouse
    * SFTP Users

## 0.21.0

* Glue workflows now sets StartOnCreation property to 'true' automatically if the Trigger State=ACTIVATED

## 0.20.0

* Resolved ConcurrentModificationException when many triggers add to the same workflow
* 'mdaa destroy' will now attempt to destroy stacks in reverse order of creation.

## 0.19.0

* Added warehouseBucketUserRoles to Warehouse App to allow non-admin access to Warehouse bucket to be granted
* Moved job and crawler monitoring event bridge rules to job and crawler apps (from Workflow app)
  * An EventBridge rule will now be created per job/crawler

## 0.18.0

* Modify DataWarehouse to not create secret rotation if rotationDays is 0
  * Note that this triggers a CDK Nag which needs to be suppressed (see below)
* Add nag_suppressions config to modules in mdaa.yaml
  * Suppressions currently supported by path, which should be available in Nag error message
* Add app_config_data and tag_config_data to mdaa.yaml, allowing for tags and Mdaa module/CDK App config object data to be directly specified in MDAA
* Refactored/Renamed MDAA App Configs to use ConfigParser terminology, in preparation for larger future refactoring
* Fixed issue with DataOps Workflow and Scheduled Triggers
* Refactored and cleaned up code smells from SonarQube
* Added ability to configure Redshift snapshot retention period

## 0.17.0

* Resolve deployment role naming issue with DataOps Project

## 0.16.0

* Added global/domain/module mdaa_version configuration param to allow MDAA version to specified at various locations in the MDAA config
* Removed the MDAA version from the mdaa_cdk_app tag to reduce CDK diff churn during MDAA upgrades/deployments
* Fixed issue where CDK Custom Providers (LF, QuickSight, etc) would produce function names > 64 chars
* Fixed issue where multiple federations in a Data Warehouse config would create a naming conflict
* Region and Account can now be referenced in MDAA configs as '{{region}}' and '{{account}}'. These will automatically be replaced at Synth time
* Improved Dynamic Reference docs
* Added custom CDK aspects to MDAA configuration. These are dynamically injected at MDAA execution time similar to custom naming implementations.

## 0.15.0

* Replace 'Ecosystem' with 'Environment' across MDAA codebase.

## 0.14.0

* Fix dependency issue between LF Locations and LF Grants in DataLake Stack
* Modify DataWarehouse to generate scheduled action starttime in future if required
* Modify DataLake to always add bucket allow statement even if DefaultDeny is false
* Modify DataLake to accept defaultDeny configuration per bucket instead of per access policy

## 0.13.0

* Added LF Data Location grants to Data Lake Stack, based on configured Lake Formation Resource Locations. Specified roles will be granted access to create catalog resources in the specified location.
* Added RedShift user and secret creation to DataWarehouse App/Stack, allowing for non-admin users to be managed by MDAA configuration. A secret will be created containing the credentials for each user, with configurable rotation.
* Added -h (help) flag to MDAA cli, which will print available cli flags and exit
* Added -r (role) flag to MDAA cli, which will pass the specified role arn to the -r flag of the underlying CDK command. This allows deployment to be conducted using non-default roles.

## 0.12.0

* Lock CDK version (currently 2.29.0)
  * Resolves compatability issue introduced by <https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/pull/20911>
* Added public IP support to SFTP Server
* Added Data Science Team App and Stack

## 0.11.0

Dependency cleanup

## 0.10.0

### Configuration Changes

* Support for specification of additional context values in mdaa.yaml at the org, domain, env, or module level.
* Context values from mdaa.yaml can be referenced in individual MDAA module/app configs:
  * {{org}} - resolves to the org name
  * {{domain}} - resolves to the domain name
  * {{env}} - resolves to the env name
  * {{module_name}} - resolves to the module name
  * {{context:< some context key >}} - resolves to the additional context value in mdaa.yaml
* CFN dynamic references are mostly supported in MDAA module/app configs:
  * {{resolve:< service >:< some key >}} - is passed through to the CloudFormation template. This allows referencing things like secrets ,etc, in MDAA configs without storing the secrets in the config itself.
  * Example: {{resolve:ssm:< some ssm path >}}
* Both context and CFN dynamic references can be referenced inline in config values, and should always be quoted:
  * some-config-key: “{{context:some-context-key}}”
  * some-config-key: “somestring-{{context:some-context-key}}-somemorestring”

### Compliance Changes

* MDAA now automatically applies the HIPAA CDK Nag Ruleset
  * This is in addition to the existing NIST 800-53 R5 and AWS Solution Rulesets
  * CDK Nag executes automatically as part of any mdaa synth, diff, deploy command and will halt deployment if security issues are encountered.
* Fixed CDK Nag Aws-Solutions-L1 (Lambda runtime) for MDAA custom resources
* Pinned CDK Nag to current latest version to prevent unexpected nags due to new rules in the future

### Functional Changes

* Lake Formation Settings app added to manage LF admins and default permissions for databases/tables
* Default MDAA tags now added to all resources with org/domain/env/module_name and cdk app/version

### Extensibility Changes

* MDAA config-driven apps were separated from their CDK stacks, allowing for reusability of MDAA stacks in custom applications
  * All stacks are JSII compliant and include Python bindings.
  * Stacks are now in separate packages with a ‘-stack’ suffix
  * There is now a clear separation between MDAA app config concepts and stacks, which are Props-driven in alignment with the rest of the CDK codebase

* Added JSII-produced cross language bindings (currently for Python) for all MDAA reusable constructs and stacks
  * PIP packages are automatically published to CodeArtifact for prerelease (MDAA Dev) and releases (MDAA Delivery)
  * Updated README with more info on how to Build On/Extend MDAA

### Structural Changes

* The MDAA deploy package (formerly @aws-mdaa/mdaa-deploy) has been renamed to ‘@aws-mdaa/cli’
  * This better aligns with conventions used in similar AWS codebases
  * You’ll want to uninstall ‘@aws-mdaa/mdaa-deploy’, then install ‘@aws-mdaa/cli’

* The repo structure has been slightly reorganized, but MDAA App packages names all remain the same
* More Stack/App refactoring to fix an issue with using cross stack references
