# Deployment

## Deployment Overview

The following are procedures which can be executed in order to manually deploy MDAA to target accounts. These procedures assume that the appropriate [preparations](PREDEPLOYMENT.md) have been made within the organizations accounts.

## Deployment Patterns

MDAA may be deployed using a number of patterns:

### Same Deployment Source and Target Account (Centralized Data Environment)

### Single Deployment Source account, One or More Separate Target Accounts (Centralized deployment governance, decentralized Data Environments)

## Deployment Preparation

### Node Installation

Install a version of Node.js using a method appropriate to your system.

**MDAA requires nodejs 22.x and npm/npx version 8.x or greater.**

### Docker Installation

Some MDAA modules make use of Docker both for building deployable code assets, as well as for building Docker images.

Install a version of Docker CLI (or suitable alternative) using a method appropriate to your system. MDAA has been tested with both Docker CLI and Finch.
If using a Docker alternative, be sure to set `CDK_DOCKER` to the correct path.

### PIP Installation

Where Docker is not available, some MDAA modules may attempt to package code assets directly using Pip.
Install a version of Python3.1x using a method appropriate to your system.

### Environment Setup

Ensure your credentials are populated either in your environment or in your ~/.aws/credentials file.
Also, ensure your AWS region is specified either in your environment or in your ~/.aws/config file:

```bash
[default]
region=ca-central-1
```

### Deployment from Locally Cloned Source Code

As of MDAA 0.40, deployment from locally cloned MDAA source code is the preferred deployment mode, as it avoids requiring MDAA NPM packages to be published. As of 0.43, specification of the '-l' flag is no longer required to force local execution mode. Modules which are available in locally cloned MDAA source code will be used. Otherwise, the required packages will be installed via NPM.

1. Clone MDAA repo.
2. Run `<path_to_cloned_repo>/bin/mdaa -c <path_to_mdaa_yaml> <cdk action>`
   - MDAA will run npm install at the root of the cloned repo to install CDK and all necessary third-party dependencies.
   - MDAA will locate its own modules within the local source code repo
   - **Note that specifying specific MDAA versions in local_mode will result in NPM packages being installed**

Additional MDAA CLI commands:

Use the -h parameter to print a list of all MDAA CLI parameters

```bash
<path_to_cloned_repo>/bin/mdaa -h
```

Use the -c parameter to specify a config config file. Otherwise MDAA CLI will attempt to use mdaa.yaml from the local directory.

```bash
<path_to_cloned_repo>/bin/mdaa -c <optional-path-to-mdaa-config-file> <cdk action>
```

Specify a < cdk action >, which MDAA CLI will run against every configured module/CDK app:

```bash
<path_to_cloned_repo>/bin/mdaa <cdk action>
```

To list (Terraform validate) all stacks:

```bash
<path_to_cloned_repo>/bin/mdaa list
```

To synth (Terraform validate) all stacks:

```bash
<path_to_cloned_repo>/bin/mdaa synth
```

To diff (Terraform plan) all stacks:

```bash
<path_to_cloned_repo>/bin/mdaa diff
```

To deploy (Terraform deploy) all stacks:

```bash
<path_to_cloned_repo>/bin/mdaa deploy
```

To deploy only env=dev modules/stacks:

```bash
<path_to_cloned_repo>/bin/mdaa deploy -e dev
```

To deploy only domain1 and domain2 modules/stacks:

```bash
<path_to_cloned_repo>/bin/mdaa deploy -d domain1,domain2
```

To deploy only the test_roles_module and test_datalake_module modules/stacks:

```bash
<path_to_cloned_repo>/bin/mdaa deploy -m test_roles_module,test_datalake_module
```

Any CLI params not recognized by MDAA CLI will be pushed down to the CDK/Terraform CLI. In this example, `--no-rollback` will be pushed down to CDK:

```bash
<path_to_cloned_repo>/bin/mdaa deploy --no-rollback
```

### Deployment from Published NPM Packages

MDAA can be installed from a private NPM package repo, and will also attempt to install MDAA modules from a private NPM repo. This is necessary if specific MDAA versions are specified in mdaa.yaml.

Ensure that your private NPM repo is accessible and contains the appropriate MDAA NPM artifacts. If using a localhost based NPM repo (such as Verdaccio), ensure it is running on localhost and updated with the latest MDAA packages from S3 (See [PREDEPLOYMENT](PREDEPLOYMENT.md)). When executed from its NPM package, MDAA will also attempt to NPM install each MDAA module from NPM repo.

Install MDAA from your private NPM repository using:

Global Installation:

```bash
npm install -g @aws-mdaa/cli
```

Then, MDAA can be executed globally:

```bash
mdaa -h
```

Optionally, both the MDAA CLI can be instead npm installed in a local directory:

```bash
npm install @aws-mdaa/cli
```

MDAA commands can then be run within the local directory using NPX.

```bash
npx mdaa -h
```

## Deployment of MDAA Modules/CDK Apps using CDK CLI

MDAA Modules are developed as independant CDK apps which can be directly executed using the CDK CLI. This is generally useful for development and troubleshooting directly against the MDAA codebase, but is not recommended for normal use.

To execute MDAA Modules/CDK apps using the CDK CLI:

1. Clone the MDAA source repo.
2. At the root of the repo, run `npm install` to install all packages required across all modules.
3. Change directory to the MDAA Modules/CDK apps source code directory (typically under packages/apps/< module category >/< module >)
4. Run the following CDK commands with the required context:

```bash
cdk synth -c org=<organization> -c env=<dev|test|prod> -c domain=<domain name> -c module_configs=<app_config_paths> -c tag_configs=<tag_config_paths> -c module_name=<module_name>
```

```bash
cdk synth -c org="sample-org" -c env="dev" -c domain="mdaa1" -c module_configs="warehouse.yaml" -c tag_configs="tags.yaml"  -c module_name="testing"
```

### Required Context

The following context values are required for all modules. Note that additional context values may be required if context is referenced from within the module/app config.

- **org** - Name of the organization

- **env** - Name of the target environment (ie. dev/test/prod)

- **domain** - Name of the deployment domain (allows multiple deployments in same org/env/account)

- **module_name** - Name of the MDAA module (allows multiple deployments of the same CDK app within same org/domain/env)

- **module_configs** - Comma separated list of paths to one or more app config files (see Configuration). Multiple config files will be merged, with later-listed config files taking precedence over earlier-listed config files.

- **tag_configs** - Comma separated list of paths to one or more tag config files (see Configuration). Multiple config files will be merged, with later-listed config files taking precedence over earlier-listed config files.
